# MicrobitLab--How-to-activate-pins-on-microbit

# This is file is instructions for how to actiate little pins on the bottom part of the microbit. 

# NOTE: You CANNOT program this code without a BBC microbit version 1

Please use this link to copy the code which is located in an other file in this repository.
https://python.microbit.org/v/2

Copy the code in the editor.

# NOTE: Please make sure that you put tabs after every line depending on what line you are writing
I have written the code in the format it has to be written, so when you are copying it to the python editor, please use my format.

# How to connect the microbit to your device ?
Use a USB cable and plug the little end to the mcrobit. Use the other side to plug it into your device.

# How activating pins work ?
If we touch one of the pins, we can choose which image we want it to show and the remaining time we don't touch the pin, we can also choose the image we want it to show. 

# What do you do when you are done ?
When you are done writing the code, click the download button on the top left corner of the tab. Next, you will get a pop up on the bottom of your screen, press the arrow to open a little box whic will include "Open file location" Grab the file and drop it to the microbit file.

Then wait to see the magic happen on the microbit. If it says syntax error on line "3" for example, please check you code again. :)
